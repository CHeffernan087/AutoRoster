# AutoRoster
Automated Rostering System built for Tayto Park. Never accepted by the company but cool nonetheless :) Uses processing core library to provide nice intuitive user interface to automatically produce roster. Programme reads in .txt file (file path chosen by user), and produces roster automatically based on the employee names inside the .txt file. Has some basic logic to ensure roster is fair /  doesnt break employee law e.g worker cant work more than 60hrs a week, all workers should be allocated an equal amount of hours etc . Not Perfect / unfinished, as I said the company did not want to make use of this technology. Does employ some nice excel-like functionality whereby the user can edit cells in the table/ award time off, with the shifts being automatically reassigned to other workers
